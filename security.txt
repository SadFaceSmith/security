## Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of Grafana Labs's open source and commercial products (including but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com). We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address.

Please encrypt your message to us; please use our PGP key. The key fingerprint is:

F988 7BEA 027A 049F AE8E 5CAA D125 8932 BE24 C5CA

The key is available from keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Grafana Labs will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. We will maintain contact and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Important: We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it has been fixed and announced. If you reported it to any third parties, we request that you inform us immediately. If you wish, we will coordinate a public release date with you. Proper credit and acknowlegements will be given to you if you want.

We respect your work and we commit to follow Responsible Discloure, aka [Coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). We usually fix issues in a matter of days or weeks, staying well below the industry-standard 90 days. You can verify this yourself:
